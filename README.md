### DPS907 and WSA500 for the Fall 2015 semester

**Code examples**

Organized by week. Each "week" folder/page has a "read me" file that describes the example.  

You can browse the code online. 

You can also pull the repository to your own computer (clone or download).  

**How to use "Download ZIP"**

Download to a folder. Unzip.  

Notice that each code example folder does NOT include a "packages" folder. Why? To reduce the download size.  

Before running a code example, do a build/compile. That will fetch the packages needed by the project.  

*Problems?* Please contact your professor for help.
